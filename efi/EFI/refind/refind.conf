textonly

# Set the EFI text mode to be used for textual displays. This option
# takes a single digit that refers to a mode number. Mode 0 is normally
# 80x25, 1 is sometimes 80x50, and higher numbers are system-specific
# modes. Mode 1024 is a special code that tells rEFInd to not set the
# text mode; it uses whatever was in use when the program was launched.
# If you specify an invalid mode, rEFInd pauses during boot to inform
# you of valid modes.
# CAUTION: On VirtualBox, and perhaps on some real computers, specifying
# a text mode and uncommenting the "textonly" option while NOT specifying
# a resolution can result in an unusable display in the booted OS.
# Default is 1024 (no change)

# Tool binaries to be excluded from the tools line, even if the
# general class is specified in showtools. This enables trimming an
# overabundance of tools, as when you see multiple mok_tool entries
# after installing multiple Linux distributions.
# Just as with dont_scan_files, you can specify a filename alone, a
# full pathname, or a volume identifier (filesystem label, partition
# name, or partition GUID) and a full pathname.
# Default is an empty list (nothing is excluded)

# Directories in which to search for EFI drivers. These drivers can
# provide filesystem support, give access to hard disks on plug-in
# controllers, etc. In most cases none are needed, but if you add
# EFI drivers and you want rEFInd to automatically load them, you
# should specify one or more paths here. rEFInd always scans the
# "drivers" and "drivers_{arch}" subdirectories of its own installation
# directory (where "{arch}" is your architecture code); this option
# specifies ADDITIONAL directories to scan.
# Default is to scan no additional directories for EFI drivers
#
#scan_driver_dirs EFI/tools/drivers,drivers

# Which types of boot loaders to search, and in what order to display them:
#  internal      - internal EFI disk-based boot loaders
#  external      - external EFI disk-based boot loaders
#  optical       - EFI optical discs (CD, DVD, etc.)
#  netboot       - EFI network (PXE) boot options
#  hdbios        - BIOS disk-based boot loaders
#  biosexternal  - BIOS external boot loaders (USB, eSATA, etc.)
#  cd            - BIOS optical-disc boot loaders
#  manual        - use stanzas later in this configuration file
#  firmware      - boot EFI programs set in the firmware's NVRAM
# Note that the legacy BIOS options require firmware support, which is
# not present on all computers.
# The netboot option is experimental and relies on the ipxe.efi and
# ipxe_discover.efi program files.
# On UEFI PCs, default is internal,external,optical,manual
# On Macs, default is internal,hdbios,external,biosexternal,optical,cd,manual
#
#scanfor internal,external,optical,manual,firmware

# Directories that should NOT be scanned for boot loaders. By default,
# rEFInd doesn't scan its own directory, the EFI/tools directory, the
# EFI/memtest directory, the EFI/memtest86 directory, or the
# com.apple.recovery.boot directory. Using the dont_scan_dirs option
# enables you to "blacklist" other directories; but be sure to use "+"
# as the first element if you want to continue blacklisting existing
# directories. You might use this token to keep EFI/boot/bootx64.efi out
# of the menu if that's a duplicate of another boot loader or to exclude
# a directory that holds drivers or non-bootloader utilities provided by
# a hardware manufacturer. If a directory is listed both here and in
# also_scan_dirs, dont_scan_dirs takes precedence. Note that this
# blacklist applies to ALL the filesystems that rEFInd scans, not just
# the ESP, unless you precede the directory name by a filesystem name or
# partition unique GUID, as in "myvol:EFI/somedir" to exclude EFI/somedir
# from the scan on the myvol volume but not on other volumes.
#
dont_scan_dirs ESP:/EFI/boot,EFI/arch,EFI/memtest86

# Files that should NOT be included as EFI boot loaders (on the
# first line of the display). If you're using a boot loader that
# relies on support programs or drivers that are installed alongside
# the main binary or if you want to "blacklist" certain loaders by
# name rather than location, use this option. Note that this will
# NOT prevent certain binaries from showing up in the second-row
# set of tools. Most notably, various Secure Boot and recovery
# tools are present in this list, but may appear as second-row
# items.
# The file may be specified as a bare name (e.g., "notme.efi"), as
# a complete pathname (e.g., "/EFI/somedir/notme.efi"), or as a
# complete pathname with volume (e.g., "SOMEDISK:/EFI/somedir/notme.efi"
# or 2C17D5ED-850D-4F76-BA31-47A561740082:/EFI/somedir/notme.efi").
# OS tags hidden via the Delete or '-' key in the rEFInd menu are
# added to this list, but stored in NVRAM.
# The default is shim.efi,shim-fedora.efi,shimx64.efi,PreLoader.efi,
# TextMode.efi,ebounce.efi,GraphicsConsole.efi,MokManager.efi,HashTool.efi,
# HashTool-signed.efi,bootmgr.efi,fb{arch}.efi
# (where "{arch}" is the architecture code, like "x64").
# If you want to keep these defaults but add to them, be sure to
# specify "+" as the first item in the new list; if you don't, then
# items from the default list are likely to appear.
#
#dont_scan_files shim.efi,MokManager.efi

# EFI NVRAM Boot#### variables that should NOT be presented as loaders
# when "firmware" is an option to "scanfor". The comma-separated list
# presented here contains strings that are matched against the
# description field -- if a value here is a case-insensitive substring
# of the boot option description, then it will be excluded from the
# boot list. To specify a string that includes a space, enclose it
# in quotes. Specifying "shell" will counteract the automatic
# inclusion of built-in EFI shells.
